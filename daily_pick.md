# Daily Pick

This is for tracking daily papers, daily news, my daily discoveries/thoughts/work in the area.

Inspired by [GenAI_LLM_timeline](https://github.com/hollobit/GenAI_LLM_timeline) and [Daily Papers](https://papers.labml.ai/papers/daily/) but personalized and certainly incomplete.

Papers, discoveries are dated by the time I noticeed their importance[^1]. News are dated by the time they happened.

Style: only key words in the table, extra info should be found via the link or the food note.

[^1]: Models and datasets are already track seperately as machine-digestable files, and some on [my likes](https://huggingface.co/utensil/activity/likes). Repos are tracked by [my stars](https://github.com/utensil/awesome-stars/blob/master/topics.md), mostly in topic `ai`, `data`, `data-science` and `data-analysis`.
